# Practical 10
Don't forget to make a new branch, `prac_10_feedback` _before_ you start.  
You will put some files into that branch for your normal practicals project/repo, but you will also have separate
projects and repositories for the Flask tasks.

Today we will explore the use of tools for **testing**, an **API** for Wikipedia and the very cool **Flask** Web
framework.  
But first, let's reflect on the subject so far...

# Reflection

Create a `README.md` markdown file in your `prac_10` folder.

Add the heading, `# Reflection`.  
Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following:

1. Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve
  during the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?
 During the practical that i could estimate, by learning from my mistakes from practical 1 till 9 which made my progress of accuracy better level.
 If you make mistakes its fine but i learn that through your mistakes you can reach the accuracy level on point with patience during learning.
2. Regarding **code reviews**, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews? 
 I discovered that reviews may be used in a variety of ways to enhance a program. 
 I also gained a lot of knowledge from the comments and advice made by others.
3. Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
 To reinforce theoretical concepts and practical skills, if I were in charge of the topic, 
 I would think about merging them with real-world initiatives. 
 Furthermore, in order to improve students' cooperation, communication, and problem-solving abilities, 
 I would place a strong emphasis on collaborative learning opportunities like pair programming 
 and group projects.


Next, add the heading, `# Code Reviews`.  
Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past 
pracs.For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.  

PRAC 06 GUITAR.PY : https://github.com/Quinn368/cp1404practicals/tree/prac_06_feedback
COMMENT : CODE IS GOOD, GREAT JOB
Explanation: The code is clear and readable which is well-organised and easy to follow as the use of meaningful
             variable names enhances readability.

PRAC 07 PROJECT MANAGEMENT.PY : (https://github.com/Quinn368/cp1404practicals/tree/prac_07_feedback)
COMMENT: THE CODE IS GOOD BUT I FELT THAT WHILE TRUE HAS BEEN USED WHICH IS ONLY FOR ERROR CHECKING BUT OTHER THAN THAT
         IS OKAY.
EXPLANATION: THE STRENGTHS OF THE CODE CHANGES WHICH ALLOWS IT TO BE WELL WRITTEN MAKES IT A GOOD CODE.
