# Answers to the expressions:
# numbers[0] = 3
# numbers[-1] = 2
# numbers[3] = 1
# numbers[:-1] = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
# numbers[3:4] = [1]
# 5 in numbers = True
# 7 in numbers = False
# "3" in numbers = [False]
# numbers + [6, 5, 3] = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3]

numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]

# Changing the first element to "ten"
numbers[0] = "ten"

# Changing the last element to 1
numbers[-1] = 1

# Printing all elements except the first two
print(numbers[2:])

# Checking if 9 is an element of numbers
print(9 in numbers)
